**What you get:** Instant Python environment, perfect for testing code snippets.

---

### **Option 3: Local Setup (For Developers)**
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fahdshaikh/brainbytes-ds.git
cd brainbytes-ds

# 2. Set up environment (choose one)
# Python virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt

# OR with conda:
conda create -n brainbytes python=3.9
conda activate brainbytes
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
```

## 🎓 **Your First 5 Minutes**

Once you're set up, start with:

```bash
# 1. Run your first data science code
python course/01_foundations/lesson.py

# 2. Or open Jupyter for interactive learning
jupyter lab
# Then navigate to: course/01_foundations/lesson.ipynb
```
